# Writing Session

A completely black screen with a centered, 80x50 vim session.

Underneath this is an autogenerated tmux session consisting of three
horizontal and three vertical panels in a layout resembling:

    A A B B D D
    A A C C D D
    A A C C D D
    A A D D D D

With the panel borders set black.

All panels run a bash session with the PS1 set to a black ampersant and the
PROMPT\_COMMAND unset.

The center panel runs a vim session with all plugins other than colourschemes
disabled and an explicitly hidden foldcolumn, cursorline and showmode.

In addition the first hundred lines of the document are padded with newline
characters to hide the empty line characters; if only there was a way to
simply disable them.

The end result is as follows:
